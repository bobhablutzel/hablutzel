    The Chief Architect is the key role for the organization. In most organizations, the Chief Architect
    not only has the responsibility of being the most experienced architect in the organization, but also
    in managing the team of architects. This dual role requires a mix of people leadership and architectural
    capabilities that can be hard to find.</p>
  <p>Of course, there are exceptions. Some organizations hire a pure people leader for the Chief Architect
    role, and others keep the role as an individual contributor. In general, both of these are compromises.
    Decoupling the Chief Architect and the people leadership role creates an organization with two heads - the
    managerial and the architectural. This confuses the reporting structure and violates the general principle
    of having a single person in charge of a given organization. It's generally more effective to leverage the

    to create a small leadership team
    that the Chief Architect can manage without management doesn't become the overriding part of their daily
    activities. This is particularly important in organizations with highly structured HR processes.

  <p>The job description below can be scaled for an overall enterprise, a line of business, or a smaller
    engineering organization. In doing so, it's important to recognize which capabilities are delegated down
    to the level being hired for, and clarify the roles and responsibilities as part of the editing of this
    job description. Failing to do this creates a misalignment between expectations and actual autonomy once
    the candidate joins the organization.</p>
  <p>As with all other job descriptions, this will have to be edited to align with the talent acquisition
    standards at your organization.</p>
